# Definition of a client type (read: Company, Organization, â€¦)

# This is not necessarily the organizational structure of the client.
# It may reflect the organizational structure but it actually is the credit structure of the particular client.
# The credit structure defines the ways that credits can be distributed among the participants.
#
# The idea is to provide the policy here and map it to our low-end, generic credit transfer/grouping
# mechanism(s).

# Also, these structures are kind of static and are considered integral part of the business case each client
# represents/is characterized by.
