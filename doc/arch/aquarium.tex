\subsection*{Abstract}

An important part of public IaaS offerings is resource management and
customer billing. In this paper we present the design and
implementation of Aquarium, an extensible billing service software.
Aquarium associates state changes in cloud resources with respective
charges, based on configurable, user-specific and versioned charging
policies. The implementation of Aquarium is characterized by pervasive
data immutability, actor message passing, and service orientation.

\section{Introduction}

Public cloud infrastructures have emerged as an alternative to
building and maintaining expensive proprietary data
centers~\cite{Lourid10}. An important part of all public clouds is
resource management and customer billing~\cite{Armbr10}. Even though
all proprietary platforms feature mechanisms for billing customers for
resource usage, there is currently a lack of open solutions.

In this paper we present Aquarium, an open source resource billing software,
designed to handle the production  requirements of \grnet's public
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. Aquarium utilizes a custom Domain
Specific Language ({\sc dsl}) for configuring the supported resources, the
price lists, and the billing algorithms. It receives input from an event queue
and presents billing results through a {\sc rest api}. It has been developed
in Scala, using the Akka library to handle concurrency and actor-based
event processing. In the following sections we present the requirements
that have driven Aquarium's design, the software architecture and
implementation of important computational algorithms, and a preliminary
evaluation of Aquarium's performance. 

\section{Requirements}

Aquarium is developed to provide accounting and billing to \grnet's
cloud computing services---although its design ensures that it can be
used by other cloud infrastructures. These services include provision
of {\sc vm}s and online storage; additional services will be built on
top of them (for instance, repository services and services for big
data computations). Aquarium should be therefore able to:

\begin{itemize}

\item Provide accounting and billing for different resources, not all
  of them known in advance.

\item Allow the application of different pricing policies to different
  resources, for different users, at different periods of time.

\item Allow for dynamic modification of any of the above, while
  maintaining full traceability of changes.

\item Provide a consistent (not just eventually consistent) view of
  users' resource usage and billing while scaling to thousands of
  concurrent users.

\end{itemize}

As Aquarium must accommodate different resources with different
policies for different users over time, we were faced either with a
logistical nightmare of giving users resource chunks directly, or
adopting a monetary approach, where users are given credit that they
can use as they see fit. While in \grnet's case users are not charged
real money for using the services, so the credit is virtual, this
should not make any difference to Aquarium. \grnet will supply virtual
currency to its users, which they will be able to spend on acquiring
and using resources. If real cash were used, \grnet (or any entity
using Aquarium) would only need to substitute real credit for virtual
credit, without any changes in Aquarium itself.

Aquarium is in the critical path of user requests that modify resource
state; all supported applications must query Aquarium in order to
ensure that the user has enough credits to create a new resource. This
means that for a large number of users (in the order of tens of thousands),
Aquarium must update and maintain in a queryable form their credit
status, with soft real time guarantees.

Being on the critical path also means that Aquarium must be highly
resilient. If Aquarium fails, even for a short period of time, it must
not loose any billing events, as this will allow users to use
resources without being charged. Moreover, in case of failure,
Aquarium must not corrupt any billing data, while it should reach an
operating state very fast after a service restart.

\section{Resources, Events, Policies and Cost Calculation}

A resource represents an entity that can be charged for. Aquarium does
not assume a fixed set of resource types and is extensible to any
number of resources. A resource is associated with a name and a cost
unit. Depending on whether a resource can have many instances per
user, a resource can be complex or simple. Finally, each resource is
associated with a cost calculation policy.

Usage of resources by users of external systems triggers the generation or
resource events, which are received by Aquarium and charged for on a per user
basis. As an example, after a successful file upload to a cloud storage
service, a resource event for the \textsf{diskspace} resource along with the
amount of bytes consumed will be sent to Aquarium.  Figure~\ref{fig:resevt}
presents an example of a {\sc json}-formatted resource event.  Apart from
resource events, Aquarium also processes events relating to users
(e.g., user creation).

}

\end{figure}

The cost calculation engine in Aquarium is configured by a 
custom {\sc dsl}, based on the {\sc yaml} format. The {\sc dsl} enables
us to specify resources, charging algorithms and
price lists and combine them arbitrarily into agreements applicable to
specific users, user groups or the whole system. It
supports inheritance for policies, price lists and agreements and
composition in the case of agreements. It also facilitates the
definition of generic, repeatable debiting rules, that specify
periodically refills of users credits.

In Figure~\ref{fig:dsl}, we present the definition of a simple but
valid policy. Policy parsing is done top down, so the order of
definition is important. The definition starts with a resource, whose
name is then re-used when attaching a price list and a charging
algorithm to it. In the case of price lists, we present an example of
\emph{temporal overloading}; the \texttt{everyTue2} pricelist
overrides the default one, but only for all repeating time frames
between every Tuesday at 02:00 and Wednesday at 02:00, starting from
the timestamp indicated at the \texttt{from} field.

%\section{Computational aspects}
%\label{computation}

\paragraph{Cost calculation}In order to charge based on the incoming
resource events, time (\DTime) and the unit of measure (\DUnitR) for a
resource ($R$) play a central role. Below, we present charging
scenarios for three well-known resources, namely \textsf{bandwidth},
\textsf{diskspace} and \textsf{vmtime}. For the analysis of each case,
we assume:

\begin{itemize}
\item The arrival of two consecutive resource events, happening at
  times $t_0$ and $t_1$, with a time difference of
  $\Delta T = t_1 - t_0$.

\item The total values of resource $R$ for times $t_0$ and $t_1$ are
  $U_R^0$ and $U_R^1$ respectively.

\item A ratio of the form $[\frac{C}{D}]$ represents the
  resource-specific charging unit, where $C$ is the credit unit, and
  $D$ depends on the combination of the previously discussed
  dimensions ($T$, $U_R$) that enters the calculation. The meaning of
  the factor is ``credits per $D$''.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\textsf{bandwidth}}
In this case, an event at $t_1$ records a change of bandwidth, using
the relevant unit of measure $U_R$. The credit usage computation is
$\Delta U_R \cdot [ \frac{C}{U_R} ]$. For example, let $\Delta U_R =
\MB{10}$; then the bandwidth charging unit $[ \frac{C}{U_R} ]$ is
``$credits$ per {\sc MB}'', since $U_R$ is measured in {\sc MB}.

\paragraph{\textsf{diskspace}}
We take into account the disk space $U_R^0$ occupied at $t_0$ together
with the time passed, $\Delta T$. The credit usage computation is
$U_R^{0} \cdot \Delta T \cdot [ \frac{C}{U_R \cdot T} ]$. That is,
when we receive a new state change for disk space, we calculate for
how long we occupied the total disk space without counting the new
state change. If we had \GB{1} at $t_0 = \secs{1}$ and we gained
another \GB{3.14} at $t_1 = \secs{3.5}$ then we are charged for the
\GB{1} we occupied for $3.5 - 1 = 2.5$ seconds. The disk space
charging unit $[ \frac{C}{U_R \cdot T} ]$ is ``$credits$ per {\sc GB}
per $sec$'', assuming $U_R$ (disk space) is measured in {\sc GB} and
time in $sec$.

\paragraph{\textsf{vmtime}}
Events for VM usage come into pairs that record \textsf{on} and
\textsf{off} states of the VM. We use the time difference between
these events for the credit usage computation, given by $\Delta T
\cdot [ \frac{C}{T} ]$.

The charging algorithms for the sample resources given previously
motivate related cost policies, namely \textsf{discrete},
\textsf{continuous} and \textsf{onoff}. Resources employing the
\textsf{discrete} cost policy are charged just like
\textsf{bandwidth}, those employing the \textsf{continuous} cost
policy are charged like \textsf{diskspace} and finally resources with
a \textsf{onoff} cost policy are charged like \textsf{vmtime}. Due to
space limits we omit a more detailed analysis and the description of
more involved scenarios.

Scheduled tasks compute total charges, the updated resource state and
a total credit amount for each billing period. This computation is
recorded in a persistent store, in an append-only fashion, for future
reference and as a cached value. This cached value can be handy in
computations or in system crashes, to avoid recomputation based on the
whole history of events.

\section{Performance}

To evaluate the performance of Aquarium, we formulated an experiment
that evaluated two important properties: the time required to perform
the charging operation for a resource event and the overall time
required to process a resource event, end to end. To conduct the
experiment, Aquarium was configured using the policy {\sc dsl} to
handle billing events for 5 types of resources, using 3 overloaded
price lists, 2 overloaded algorithms, all of which were combined to 5
different agreements. Aquarium's data store was pre-filled in with
1,000,000 resource events, evenly distributed among 1,000 users. To
drive the benchmark we used a synthetic load generator that produced
random billing events, at a configurable rate per minute.

To run the benchmark we deployed Aquarium on a virtualized 4 core
2{\sc gh}z class {\sc cpu} and 4{\sc gb} {\sc ram} Debian Linux server.
The virtual machine running Aquarium was configured with a 4{\sc gb}
maximum heap size. Rabbit{\sc mq} and Mongo{\sc db} where run in
another 4-core, 4{\sc gb ram} virtual machine. The two virtual
machines did not share a physical host and communicated over the
infrastructure's switched network fabric at an effective rate of 800
Mbits/sec, as reported by the \texttt{iperf} utility. No further
optimization was performed on either back-end system.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption{Average time for performing a billing operation and end
      for end to end message processing for 100 active users and a
      varying number of messages per minute.}
    
    \label{fig:perf}
\end{figure}

All measurements were done using the first working version of the
Aquarium deployment, so no real optimization effort has taken place.
This shows in the current performance measurements, as Aquarium was
not able to handle more than about 500 billing operations per second
(see Figure~\ref{fig:perf}). One factor that contributed to this result
was the way resource state recalculations was done; in the current
version, the system needs to re-read parts of the event and billing
state from the datastore every time a new resource event appears. This
contributes to more than 50\% of the time required to produce a
charging event, and can be completely eliminated when proper billing
snapshots are implemented. In other measurements, we also observed
that the rate of garbage creation was extremely high, more that 250
{\sc mb}/sec. Upon further investigation, we attributed it to the way
policy timeslot applicability is calculated. Despite the high
allocation rate, the {\sc jvm}'s garbage collector never went through
a full collection cycle; when we forced one after the benchmark run
was over, we observed that the actual heap memory usage was only
80{\sc mb}, which amounts to less than 1 {\sc mb} per user.

% Even so, by extrapolating on the results and hardware configuration, an average
% 12-core box could handle more 1.500 messages per minute from about 300 active
% users, at 5 events per minute. Given that activity from users is expected to
% arrive in bursts, a more realistic expectation might be to receive 1 message
% per user per 5 minutes on average; in that case, and provided that the resource
% query cost is negligible as it is being served from an in memory cache, the
% system could handle around 4.500 concurrent users. While such back of the
% envelop calculations do not account for traffic spikes, they do provide an
% rough estimation of the optimisation effort that must be put in place. 

\section{Related Work}

Yousef et al.~\cite{Youse08} described the three pricing models that
are used by cloud service providers for billing used resources, namely
tiered pricing, per-unit pricing and subscription-based pricing.
Aquarium's cost policies that are assigned to resources map exactly to
Yousef's pricing models. In fact, most offerings by public IaaS
providers, including Amazon and Azure, offer services charged
according to Yousef models.

Work on resource accounting and billing has been carried out in the
context of cloud federation~\cite{Rochw09, Elmro09} and (earlier) grid
federation projects. The Distributed Grid Accounting System ({\sc
  dgas})~\cite{Piro06} was among the first to enable resource
accounting at the computing and storage layers and then aggregation of
the resources in a centralized location. The Reservoir project
investigated the use of service level agreements~\cite{Elmro09} for
resource provisioning in federated cloud scenarios.

On the cloud computing front, vendors such as VMWare, Microsoft and
{\sc ibm} provide full stack solutions, which also include resource
accounting. Usually, such systems are connected with existing
enterprise resource planning systems. \"Ubersmith has developed an
engine dedicated to resource accounting; much like Aquarium, it tracks
resource usage and applies accounting policies to it. On the open
source front, neither the Cloustack nor the Openstack projects, have
yet incorporated billing into their services. To the best of our
knowledge, Aquarium is the first open source system to offer
configurable accounting services for IaaS deployments.

\section{Lessons Learned and Future Work}

A typesafe language was a hard requirement. Of the platforms examined,
the {\sc jvm} had the richest collection of ready made components; the
Akka library was particularly enticing for the scalability and
distribution possibilities it offered.

Scala as a language was an enabling factor; case classes permitted the
expression of data models, including the configuration {\sc dsl}, that
could be easily be serialized or read back from wire formats while
also promoting immutability through the use of the \texttt{copy()}
constructor. The pervasive use of immutability allowed us to write
strict, yet simple and concise unit tests, as the number of cases to
be examined was generally low. 

Akka's custom supervision hierarchies allowed us to partition the
system in self-healing sub-components, each of which can fail
independently of the other. For example, if the queue reader component
fails due to a queue failure, Aquarium will still be accessible and
responsive for the {\sc rest} interface. Also, Akka allowed us to
easily saturate the processing components of any system we tested
Aquarium on, simply by tuning the number of threads (in {\sc i/o}
bound parts) and actors (in {\sc cpu} bound parts) per dispatcher.

From a software engineering point of view, the current state of the
project was reached using about 8 person months of effort, 2 of which
were devoted to requirements elicitation, prototype building and
familiarizing with the language. The source code currently consists of
7,000 lines of executable statements (including about 1,200 lines of
tests), divided in about 10 packages. The system is built using both
{\sc sbt} and Maven. In the future we will add a comprehensive {\sc
  rest api} for accessing the user actor state and we will distribute
the message processing across multiple nodes in an active-active mode.
